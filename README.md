# My Numark Mixtrack Pro 3 Mixx standard config mod

I decided to mod this config file so the controller adjusts to my needs and style. Of course, I'm standing in the shoulders of giants here. I just took the standard config from Mixxx, made by these awesome people [see below], and started building on top of it.

I'm not pulling it to the official repositories since I can see it deviating a lot from the original config and I don't know if people would like it. Besides, the modifications I'm making do not necessarily represent *improvements*, but style adjustments.

## Things I have added so far
- `Shift + reloop_exit` activates beatloop;
- Effects are focused with `TAP + FX` and activated with `FX`, unlike the original file, which inverts these controls;
- The top corners pitch bend buttons set the pitch (independent of the tempo) up or down, and pressing `Shift` together with these buttons resets the pitch.

## Key features
- ICUT effect for scratching
- Fader Start
- press/double press/long press handling
- Smart PFL
- 4 deck support
- Full effect chains support from Deere Skin
